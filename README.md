# Monty hall problem - Game Simulation 

## Hi there! 
To run this application you need to start the server and client in two seperate terminals

### Server folder
- Move into server folder - `cd server`
- run `npm install`
- run `npm start`
- The server should start on localhost:3030

### Client folder
- Move into client folder - `cd client`
- run `npm install`
- run `npm start`
- The client should start on localhost:3000
